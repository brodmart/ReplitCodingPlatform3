## CRITICAL: Web Console Implementation
As of January 23, 2025, the web console implementation has been identified as the MAKE-OR-BREAK feature for this project:

1. **Core Implementation Requirements**:
   - A fully web-based interactive console that supports all required C# console operations
   - Implementation using CodeMirror editor and Xterm.js terminal for I/O operations
   - Proper Socket.IO integration for real-time I/O handling
   - This is a core feature that cannot be compromised or removed
   - Must handle basic I/O operations flawlessly
   - Real-time interaction between student code and web interface

2. **Technical Integration Requirements**:
   - Proper initialization and error handling
   - Reliable Socket.IO connection management
   - Console initialization issues need immediate resolution
   - Socket.IO connection stability must be improved
   - Element initialization timing needs optimization
   - Real-time I/O handling requires refinement

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - Successful execution of basic I/O operations
   - Reliable console initialization
   - Consistent user interaction experience
   - Zero console element initialization errors

4. **Development Timeline Impact**:
   - Estimated 100+ chat sessions for full implementation
   - 3+ days of dedicated development time
   - Multiple iterations for testing and refinement
   - Critical path for project continuation

5. **Implementation Constraints**:
   - All code compilation and I/O interactions MUST happen within the web interface
   - CodeMirror editor integration is mandatory for code input
   - Console I/O must be handled through the web console implementation
   - No command-line or external IDE compilation is allowed
   - All student interactions must occur through the web interface
   - Compiler service must integrate directly with the web console


## Development Guidelines
1. CRITICAL: Keep all implementations simple and barebones
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Implement only what's needed
   - Keep code straightforward and easily maintainable
   - Minimize dependencies and external libraries
   - Keep code straightforward and easily maintainable
2. Focus on performance optimization and minimal resource usage
3. Maintain nimbleness and efficiency as top priorities
4. Avoid heavy frameworks unless absolutely necessary
5. Prefer lightweight, modular solutions
6. Regular testing and performance monitoring
7. PROACTIVE ERROR HANDLING: When encountering obvious errors or issues that can be fixed independently, proceed with the fix without waiting for user confirmation
   - This includes syntax errors, basic configuration issues, and standard implementation problems
   - Document the changes made in the response
   - Continue with the implementation flow

## CRITICAL WARNING - Console Implementation
PERSISTENT ISSUE DOCUMENTED: There has been a recurring tendency to implement and test console functionality through command-line interfaces instead of the required web console interface. This is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

Key Points:
1. ALL console interactions MUST be implemented through the web interface using:
   - CodeMirror for code editing
   - Xterm.js for console output
   - WebSocket/HTTP for real-time I/O
2. Command-line testing (e.g., using unittest) for console functionality is NOT ACCEPTABLE
3. Console implementation must focus on web-based integration
4. Any command-line console testing should be immediately redirected to web console implementation
5. Test cases should be written for web console interaction, not command-line programs

## Console Application Compatibility Requirements
1. **Code Preservation Policy**:
   - Student code must NEVER be modified to fit the environment
   - Console applications must run as-is, exactly as they would in standard IDEs
   - Environment must adapt to support all valid code submissions
   - No suggestions to modify working code that runs in standard IDEs
2. **Console I/O Support**:
   - Full support for all C# console operations:
     * Console.Write and Console.WriteLine
     * Console.Read and Console.ReadLine
     * Console.Clear
     * Console.SetCursorPosition
     * Console.ForegroundColor and Console.BackgroundColor
     * All standard console color and formatting options
   - Interactive input handling must match standard IDE behavior
   - Support for complex console-based user interfaces
   - Proper handling of special characters and encoding
3. **Large Application Support**:
   - Support for reasonable-sized console applications (up to 10MB source code)
   - Support for extensive console-based applications within standard IDE limits
   - Full support for class hierarchies and complex data structures
   - Environment must scale to handle most student applications efficiently
   - Optimized performance for typical code bases
   - Support for multiple source files and projects
4. **IDE Compatibility**:
   - Behavior must match standard C# IDEs (Visual Studio, VS Code)
   - Consistent console behavior across all supported operations
   - Proper handling of threading and synchronization
   - Support for standard debugging output
   - Identical runtime behavior to desktop IDEs
   - Support for all valid C# console features

## Systematic Debugging Approach
1. **Frontend-Backend Analysis Pattern**:
   - Always analyze both frontend and backend components
   - Identify where the communication chain breaks
   - Verify each step of the data flow

2. **Structured Bottleneck Analysis**:
   Frontend Verification:
   - Socket.IO connection status
   - Event emission confirmation
   - Event listener setup
   - Console log monitoring
   - UI state updates

   Backend Verification:
   - Socket.IO event reception
   - Handler execution flow
   - Service integration points
   - Data processing steps
   - Response emission

3. **Progressive Debug Logging**:
   - Add detailed logging at each critical point
   - Track data transformation between layers
   - Monitor timing and performance metrics
   - Log both success and failure paths

4. **Common Bottleneck Patterns**:
   - Socket.IO event mismatches
   - Data serialization issues
   - Async/await flow breaks
   - Memory/resource constraints
   - Service integration gaps

5. **Resolution Strategy**:
   - Identify the exact break point
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Make atomic, focused fixes
   - Verify the entire chain
   - Document the solution pattern
