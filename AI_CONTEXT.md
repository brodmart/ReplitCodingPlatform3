# AI Session Context Guide
Last Updated: January 17, 2025

## Quick Start for AI Sessions:

### Priority Files for Context (Read First):
1. project_memory.md - Overall project status and architecture
2. architectural_decisions.md - Key technical decisions
3. development_patterns.md - Common patterns and practices
4. integration_notes.md - System integration details

### How to Use These Files:

1. **Initial Context Loading**:
   - Review project_memory.md first for current project status
   - Check architectural_decisions.md for key technical choices
   - Reference development_patterns.md for coding standards
   - Consult integration_notes.md for system connections

2. **During Development**:
   - Update relevant memory files when making significant changes
   - Add timestamps to updates
   - Cross-reference between files when needed
   - Document new patterns or decisions

3. **Version Control Integration**:
   - All memory files are version controlled
   - Changes are tracked with timestamps
   - Historical context is preserved

### File Update Guidelines:

1. project_memory.md:
   - Update when adding new features
   - Modify when changing core functionality
   - Add new integrations or dependencies

2. architectural_decisions.md:
   - Document new architectural choices
   - Record reasons for technical decisions
   - Track changes in system design

3. development_patterns.md:
   - Add new coding patterns
   - Update best practices
   - Document common solutions

4. integration_notes.md:
   - Update when modifying integrations
   - Document new connection parameters
   - Track integration status

### Core Educational Requirements:

1. **ICS4U Curriculum Alignment**:
   - Ontario's ICS4U (Grade 12) curriculum serves as the baseline standard for ALL platform features
   - All programming concepts must meet or exceed Grade 12 level requirements
   - Advanced topics coverage includes:
     * Object-Oriented Programming principles
     * Advanced algorithm design and analysis
     * Software engineering methodologies
     * Data structures and abstract data types
     * Program efficiency and complexity analysis
     * Recursive problem-solving techniques
     * File manipulation and database management

2. **Lexicon System Requirements**:
   - Bilingual support (French/English) with ICS4U-level terminology
   - Context-aware syntax highlighting for advanced code structures
   - Support for multiple programming paradigms at Grade 12 level
   - Advanced curriculum-specific content organization
   - Database-driven architecture for scalability
   - JSON-based content storage with curriculum mapping
   - Advanced code editor integration
   - Comprehensive search with curriculum tags
   - ICS4U curriculum alignment verification system

3. **Language Support Requirements**:
   - Primary Languages (Full ICS4U Coverage):
     * C++: Advanced OOP, templates, STL
     * C#: Advanced .NET features, LINQ, async programming
   - Secondary Languages:
     * Python: Advanced features, decorators, metaclasses
   - Future Consideration:
     * JavaScript: Advanced ES6+, TypeScript integration
   - All languages must demonstrate:
     * Advanced OOP concepts
     * Data structure implementations
     * Algorithm efficiency
     * File I/O and database operations
     * Memory management (where applicable)

4. **Assessment and Learning Analytics**:
   - Difficulty scaling based on ICS4U curriculum
   - Advanced problem complexity alignment
   - Metacognitive assessment strategies
   - Performance analytics at Grade 12 level
   - Adaptive learning paths based on ICS4U requirements

### Timestamps and Versioning:
- All updates include timestamps
- Format: "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD"
- Keep previous significant entries

### Cross-Referencing:
- Use relative links between files
- Maintain consistency in terminology
- Reference specific sections when needed

This guide helps maintain consistent project understanding across AI sessions. Always read these files at the start of each session and update them when making significant changes.
