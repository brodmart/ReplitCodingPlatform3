# AI Session Context Guide
Last Updated: January 17, 2025

## Quick Start for AI Sessions

### Priority Files for Context (Read First):
1. project_memory.md - Overall project status and architecture
2. architectural_decisions.md - Key technical decisions
3. development_patterns.md - Common patterns and practices
4. integration_notes.md - System integration details

### How to Use These Files:

1. **Initial Context Loading**:
   - Review project_memory.md first for current project status
   - Check architectural_decisions.md for key technical choices
   - Reference development_patterns.md for coding standards
   - Consult integration_notes.md for system connections

2. **During Development**:
   - Update relevant memory files when making significant changes
   - Add timestamps to updates
   - Cross-reference between files when needed
   - Document new patterns or decisions

3. **Version Control Integration**:
   - All memory files are version controlled
   - Changes are tracked with timestamps
   - Historical context is preserved

### File Update Guidelines:

1. project_memory.md:
   - Update when adding new features
   - Modify when changing core functionality
   - Add new integrations or dependencies

2. architectural_decisions.md:
   - Document new architectural choices
   - Record reasons for technical decisions
   - Track changes in system design

3. development_patterns.md:
   - Add new coding patterns
   - Update best practices
   - Document common solutions

4. integration_notes.md:
   - Update when modifying integrations
   - Document new connection parameters
   - Track integration status

### Timestamps and Versioning:
- All updates include timestamps
- Format: "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD"
- Keep previous significant entries

### Cross-Referencing:
- Use relative links between files
- Maintain consistency in terminology
- Reference specific sections when needed

This guide helps maintain consistent project understanding across AI sessions. Always read these files at the start of each session and update them when making significant changes.
