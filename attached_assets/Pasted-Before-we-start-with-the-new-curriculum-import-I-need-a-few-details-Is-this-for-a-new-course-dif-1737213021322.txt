Before we start with the new curriculum import, I need a few details:

Is this for a new course (different from ICS3U), or should we update the existing ICS3U data?
Do you have the course code and title ready?
This will help me prepare the right database structure and queries for the import process.

I understand you want to add a new course to the curriculum database. To get started with the direct import approach, could you please provide:

The course code (e.g., ICS4U)
The course title in English
The course title in French
Once you provide these basic details, we'll create the course entry and then move on to adding the strands and their content step by step.

I see you've provided the course details:

Course Code: ICD2O
English Title: "Digital Technology and Innovations in the Changing World"
Could you please provide the French title for the course? Once we have that, we can create the course entry and then move on to adding the strands systematically.

Great! I've successfully created the course entry for ICD2O. Now we can proceed with adding the strands.

To make this process smoother, could you provide the strands information first? For each strand (A, B, C, D), I'll need:

The strand title in English
The strand title in French
You can provide them one by one or all at once, whichever is more convenient for you.

I see I've successfully created the ICD2O course entry. Let's continue with adding the strands. I showed you the current strands from ICS3U for reference, but for ICD2O, we'll need your new strand information.

Could you please provide the strand titles for ICD2O? For each strand (A, B, C, D if applicable), please share:

The strand code (e.g., A, B, C, D)
The English title
The French title
You can provide them one at a time or all at once, whichever you prefer.

Great! I've successfully added the three strands for ICD2O with their French translations:

A. Computational Thinking and Making Connections / Pensée computationnelle et établissement de liens
B. Hardware, Software, and Innovations / Matériel, logiciels et innovations
C. Programming / Programmation

Now, we need the overall expectations for each strand. Could you provide the overall expectations for Strand A (Computational Thinking and Making Connections)? For each overall expectation, I'll need:

The code (e.g., A1, A2, etc.)
The description in English
And I'll help translate them to French.

I've successfully added all the overall expectations. Now we need to add the specific expectations for each overall expectation. Let's start with Strand A's overall expectation A1 (Computational Thinking, Planning, and Purpose).

Could you please provide the specific expectations for A1? For each specific expectation, I'll need:

The code (e.g., A1.1, A1.2, etc.)
The description in English
And I'll help translate them to French.
