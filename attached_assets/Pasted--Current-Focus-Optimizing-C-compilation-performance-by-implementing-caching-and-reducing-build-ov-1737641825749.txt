## Current Focus
Optimizing C# compilation performance by implementing caching and reducing build overhead
- Issue: Slow compilation time in C# main editor console
- Priority: Improve compiler performance and debugging C# compilation issues
- Target: Faster compilation and execution times
## CRITICAL: Web Console Implementation
As of January 23, 2025, the web console implementation has been identified as the MAKE-OR-BREAK feature for this project:
1. **Core Functionality Requirements**:
   - Must handle basic I/O operations flawlessly
   - Real-time interaction between student code and web interface
   - Proper initialization and error handling
   - Reliable Socket.IO connection management
2. **Development Priority**:
   - Web console functionality is the highest priority feature
   - Must be thoroughly tested with simple I/O code first
   - Essential for maintaining project viability
   - Critical for student interaction and learning experience
3. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Console initialization issues need immediate resolution
   - Socket.IO connection stability must be improved
   - Element initialization timing needs optimization
   - Real-time I/O handling requires refinement
4. **Success Metrics**:
   - Successful execution of basic I/O operations
   - Reliable console initialization
   - Consistent user interaction experience
   - Zero console element initialization errors
5. **Development Timeline Impact**:
   - Estimated 100+ chat sessions for full implementation
   - 3+ days of dedicated development time
   - Multiple iterations for testing and refinement
   - Critical path for project continuation
Critical: All code compilation and I/O interactions MUST happen within the web interface:
- CodeMirror editor integration is mandatory for code input
- Console I/O must be handled through the web console implementation
- No command-line or external IDE compilation is allowed
- All student interactions must occur through the web interface
- Compiler service must integrate directly with the web console
## CRITICAL WARNING - Console Implementation
PERSISTENT ISSUE DOCUMENTED: There has been a recurring tendency to implement and test console functionality through command-line interfaces instead of the required web console interface. This is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Key Points:
1. ALL console interactions MUST be implemented through the web interface using:
   - CodeMirror for code editing
   - Xterm.js for console output
   - WebSocket/HTTP for real-time I/O
2. Command-line testing (e.g., using unittest) for console functionality is NOT ACCEPTABLE
3. Console implementation must focus on web-based integration
4. Any command-line console testing should be immediately redirected to web console implementation
5. Test cases should be written for web console interaction, not command-line programs
## Console Application Compatibility Requirements
1. **Code Preservation Policy**:
   - Student code must NEVER be modified to fit the environment
   - Console applications must run as-is, exactly as they would in standard IDEs
   - Environment must adapt to support all valid code submissions
   - No suggestions to modify working code that runs in standard IDEs
2. **Console I/O Support**:
   - Full support for all C# console operations:
     * Console.Write and Console.WriteLine
     * Console.Read and Console.ReadLine
     * Console.Clear
     * Console.SetCursorPosition
     * Console.ForegroundColor and Console.BackgroundColor
     * All standard console color and formatting options
   - Interactive input handling must match standard IDE behavior
   - Support for complex console-based user interfaces
   - Proper handling of special characters and encoding
3. **Large Application Support**:
   - Support for reasonable-sized console applications (up to 10MB source code)
   - Support for extensive console-based applications within standard IDE limits
   - Ful...
