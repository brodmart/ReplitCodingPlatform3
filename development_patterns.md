# Development Patterns and Best Practices
Last Updated: January 17, 2025

## Code Organization

### 1. Route Organization
- Pattern: Blueprint-based route separation
- Implementation:
  ```python
  from flask import Blueprint
  blueprint = Blueprint('name', __name__)
  ```
- Usage:
  * Auth routes in auth_routes.py
  * Activity routes in activity_routes.py
  * Static pages in static_routes.py

### 2. Model Structure
- Pattern: Mixins for common functionality
- Example: SoftDeleteMixin for logical deletion
- Benefits:
  * Reusable code
  * Consistent behavior
  * Easy maintenance

### 3. Error Handling
- Pattern: Centralized error handling with logging
- Implementation:
  * Global error handlers in app.py
  * Structured logging with different levels
  * Audit logging for critical operations

## Database Interactions

### 1. Query Patterns
- Use: SQLAlchemy ORM for all database operations
- Pattern: Class methods for common queries
- Example:
  ```python
  @classmethod
  def get_active(cls):
      return cls.query.filter_by(deleted_at=None)
  ```

### 2. Transaction Management
- Pattern: Context manager for transactions
- Implementation:
  ```python
  with db.session.begin():
      # transaction operations
  ```

## Security Practices

### 1. Input Validation
- Pattern: Form-based validation with WTForms
- Implementation:
  * Server-side validation in forms.py
  * Client-side validation in templates

### 2. Authentication
- Pattern: Multi-layer security checks
- Implementation:
  * Password hashing with Werkzeug
  * Failed login tracking
  * Account locking mechanism

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Pattern: Test each model independently
- Focus:
  * Model methods
  * Form validation
  * Utility functions

### 2. Integration Testing
- Pattern: Test route functionality
- Focus:
  * Authentication flow
  * Activity completion
  * File uploads

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database Optimization
- Pattern: Efficient querying
- Implementation:
  * Use appropriate indexes
  * Eager loading for relationships
  * Query optimization

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Pattern: Multi-level caching
- Implementation:
  * Flask-Caching for route responses
  * Memory caching for frequent queries
  * Browser caching for static assets

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Backup Management
- Pattern: Automated backup system
- Implementation:
  * Daily backups via APScheduler
  * SSL-enabled transfers
  * Version control integration

### 2. Error Monitoring
- Pattern: Comprehensive logging
- Implementation:
  * Different log levels
  * Structured log format
  * Audit logging
